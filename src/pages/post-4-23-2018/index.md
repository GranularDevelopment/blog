Anyone can get a program to work. With brute force and enough developers you can keep most systems up and running. Throughout my career I see the same problem over and over again: ‘Business’ asks for a oneway street. The developers build a oneway street. Then the ‘Business’ asks for a two way street, then a four lane street, then a highway and so forth. The problem is the same. The developers built a rigid oneway street, not adaptable, not scalable, with code so messy and intractable that no one knows what it does— and let’s not forget no test coverage. The developers fall behind trying to implement the never ending business requirements, while continuing to add to the mess. As the mess builds and features increase  productivity declines and the developers continue to break everything putting in a new features every spirit. How can we fix this? The key to fixing these messes is not to make one in first place. This is where Clean Architecture comes in.

Clean Architecture starts with the familiar myths. 

* We can clean it up later; we just have to get to market first!
* Writing messy code makes you go faster in short term and only slows you down in the long term
* We can always rewrite it from scratch.

Clean Architecture, like all of Robert C. Martin’s, will help you avoid those familiar myths and common pitfalls. 

This book is not your typical software architecture book. It’s obtuse and vague, yet insightful and thought provoking. I highly recommend you pick up this book and read it two or three times.
